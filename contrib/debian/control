 .
 This package provides the daemon, zoowd, and the CLI tool
 zoow-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 ZOOW is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. ZOOW uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. ZOOW Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides zoow-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a zoow daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
